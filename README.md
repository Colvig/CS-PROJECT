# Gen 1 Pokedex for Python 3.9.7

This project requires two files. There is a ```pokedex.py``` and a ```pokestats.txt```. These both need to be downloaded into the same folder. 

Open this folder in VSCode making sure you see the text file and the python file on the left.

Tkinter is needed. To install Tkinter through VSCode navigate to the terminal and type ```pip install tk```.

This project also requires PIL and pygame. In the same terminal as before type ```pip install pillow``` for PIL, and ```pip install pygame``` for pygame.

Once both of these are installed you should be able to press run and the podedex will open.
